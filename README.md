## Description

"Little Esty Shop" was a group project assigned to us during Week 4 of Mod 2 at Turing School of Software & Design. We were to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices. Using RSpec and SimpleCov, we wrote model and feature tests that covers data logic and user behavior at 100%.

Below are the learning goals and phases that include User Stories we completed.

## Learning Goals
- Practice designing a normalized database schema and defining model relationships
- Utilize advanced routing techniques including namespacing to organize and group like functionality together.
- Utilize advanced active record techniques to perform complex database queries
- Practice consuming a public API while utilizing POROs as a way to apply OOP principles to organize code

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Rails 5.2.6
* Ruby 2.7.4
* PostgreSQL

## Phases

1. [Database Setup](./doc/db_setup.md)
1. [User Stories](./doc/user_stories.md)
1. [Extensions](./doc/extensions.md)
1. [Evaluation](./doc/evaluation.md)

## Schema Design
Below is our database design with one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
